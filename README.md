# NuteCompute

This project is an attempt to reproduce the work of [HydroBuddy](https://github.com/danielfppps/hydrobuddy) in a web application.

The main goals are thus:

1) Interface tweaks to make an easier to use nutrient calculator for dumb people like me.
2) User accounts with database backed calculation data.
